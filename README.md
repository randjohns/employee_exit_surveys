# employee_exit_surveys

An analysis of dissatisfaction data from employee exit surveys

Every great leader should liberate each member of the team through high support and high challenge so that employees stay on the team and the organization flourishes. Unfortunately, this ideal isn't always achieved for various reasons like an employee seeking the next level of achievement in his career (and not finding opportunity at the present organization) or an employee resigning out of dissatisfaction.

We will explore reasons that affect why employees resign and when they resign. For example:

- Are employees who only worked for the organization for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
- What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
- What about older employees?

To explore these questions, we will use some sample public data from exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. This project began as part of my ongoing work in the Dataquest.io curriculum.

Enjoy!
